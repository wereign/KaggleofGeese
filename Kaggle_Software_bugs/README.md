# Overview

This is the start of my attempts at Kaggle competitions

1. In my first attempt, I basically just directly plugged the dataset into AutoGluon Tabular hoping for the best
2. I will now also attempt to construct Neural Networks from Scratch in PyTorch to see how well I can match up against my own PR.

I've deleted all the models saved, except for the best one, in consideration of memory.
